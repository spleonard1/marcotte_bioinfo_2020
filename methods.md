In this project I will use publically available data to 
1. estimate the functional composition of a "normal" bee gut microbiome 
2. assemble *in silico* communties of bee gut strains 
3. estimate how well designed communities recapitulate natural microbiomes  

## Datasets
I used three previously publishes sets of metagenomes. 

For cultured isolate genomes, I downloaded them from the sequence read archive.
